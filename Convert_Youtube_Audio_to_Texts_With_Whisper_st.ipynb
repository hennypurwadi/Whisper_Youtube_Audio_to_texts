       "\" Even the arrival of the milk trucks makes the cheese maker feel a little wistful. Brexit-related losses forced Simon Sparrow to sell a majority's steak in his company. I feel betrayed and really really quite let down by a government that promised much and delivered nothing. His small business used to deliver English cheddar via mail order to private customers in the EU but thanks to Brexit every single piece of cheese now requires a certificate from the veterinary office that was prohibitively expensive. There's no way anybody's going to pay another £180 plus all the paperwork that's involved. Nearby in the Northern English town of Kru few ever imagined that Brexit would be so problematic. Even in the Brexit heartlands like here in the north of England people are reversing their opinion. Pulse show that a majority now believed that Brexit was a bad idea. However this does not mean that the decision to leave the EU will be reversed at least not anytime soon. Ron Jones imports rugs from Belgium. He's also facing a lot more at a because of Brexit. It was never a good idea. It was never a good idea but it was the will of the people. More and more studies show that post Brexit trade barriers are harming the British economy. And the lack of EU workers has caused labour shortages. I don't think it's as well as we thought it would but we did want to be ourselves again really. The doctors are stopped coming you know and the nurses there you know we are so down now. It's been an unmitigated disaster. Absolute disaster. In the meantime Simon Spiral is managing to sell cheese at a profit in the EU again via the European hub of the new majority shareholder.
